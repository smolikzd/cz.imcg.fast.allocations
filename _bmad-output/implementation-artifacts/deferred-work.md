## 1. Performance throttling for high-volume BAL logging

- **Source:** EST-120 review (edge case hunter)
- **Date:** 2026-03-20
- **Description:** With the every-message `flush_to_db()` pattern, each `message()` call triggers a DB round-trip via `save_with_2nd_connection()`. For steps that log hundreds or thousands of messages, this could degrade performance. The current spec explicitly defers this: "start with every-message flush and optimize only if performance is observed to be a problem."
- **Possible approach:** Introduce a configurable flush interval (e.g., flush every N messages or every T seconds) in `ZCL_FI_PROCESS_LOGGER`. Could use a counter field `mv_flush_interval` with a default of 1 (current behavior) that can be raised for high-volume steps.
- **Priority:** Low — only relevant if performance degradation is observed in production.
